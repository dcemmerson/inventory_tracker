Inventory Tracker App
=====================

About
------------
I built this for a friend who wanted a small web app to keep track of their medical inventory.<br><br>After entering items into the inventory list, with a corresponding quantity and burn rate (quantity per day), days left will automatically be calculated. Additionally, quantity remaining will automatically be updated every 24 hours for this item, until quantity remaing equal 0, or
user updates quantity for this item, at which point process kicks off again.

Technologies
------------
This app was built using the following tools and technologies (among others):  

* Netlify Serverless 
* FaunaDB Serverless Database
* ReactJS
* Webpack

Run it locally
--------------
To run locally, you will need NPM, which is included with NodeJS and can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/). Additionally, you will need to setup a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) instance with [identity enabled](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/). Finally, create a new [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) database to be used for this app.

1. Clone this repository  
2. Run `npm install` from the root directory  
3. Create a .env file in the root directory containing the following:<br><br>
    DB_SERVER_KEY = yourFaunaDbServerKey<br>
    NETLIFY_URL = yourNewlyCreatedNetlifyUrl<br><br>
(I recommend copying these environment variables into your Netlify instance environment variables as well right now:  Settings -> Build & Deploy -> Environment)  
4. Run `npm run dev` to start up the local development server. The app will now be available at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).   
Note that database API requests are being proxied through localhost:9000 when running locally.

Try it out
----------
A functionally limited demo version is hosted at [TrackMyInventory.netlify.app](https://TrackMyInventory.netlify.app).
